quwue
=====

Quwue is a discord bot for meeting new people. All interaction with the bot is
done via direct message, because of this you must allow direct messages from
members of the Quwue server.

If direct messages aren't allowed from members of the Quwue server, you'll
get the following error message when messaging the Quwue bot:

> Your message could not be delivered. This is usually because you don't share a server with the recipient or the recipient is only accepting direct messages from friends. You can see the full list of reasons here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060145013

## Instructions

1. Right click the quwue server in your discord server list.
2. Select "Privacy Settings".
3. Set "Direct Messages" / "Allow direct messages from server members" to on
   (slider to right).
